The motivation for picking these three papers is the following:
Graph Representation Learning has become a very important topic in the larger field of Machine Learning, as much of the information collected in many different domains includes relationships between different entities. Understanding these relationships is vital to advance our knowledge and understanding of many different phenomena. However, most of the early works in Graph Representation Learning have focused on static graphs. While some of those techniques can be adapted to work on dynamically-evolving graphs, the fact that they do not explicitly take into account the time dimension may limit their effectiveness in those scenarios in which the structure of the graph evolves quickly. This presentation will cover three of the most recent papers in the area of dynamic representation learning, to understand which directions the research community is currently exploring.
